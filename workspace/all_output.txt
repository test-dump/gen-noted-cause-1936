Code test:

```csharp
using System;

namespace HelloWorld
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
        }
    }
}
```

Code tests or unit tests provide a way to validate that the written code is working as expected. These tests provide mini-scenarios where particular functions or methods produce the expected output given a known input. They are essential in the software development cycle as they ensure the reliability and functionality of code after changes or refactoring. 

In the provided "Hello World" application, a unit test would validate that the console outputs "Hello World!". However, do note that testing console outputs is typically seen as unconventional in standard unit testing and may involve extra complexity. Normal practice includes testing for business logic, data manipulation, etc.

Nevertheless, for the sake of learning, a console test could be written using methods provided by specific testing libraries like the ` Console.SetOut` and `StringWriter` in .NET Core, to redirect Console's output into a string and then compare this string to the expected output. Here's a basic example:

```csharp
using Xunit;
using System.IO;
using System;

namespace HelloWorld.Tests
{
    public class UnitTest1
    {
        [Fact]
        public void HelloWorldTest()
        {
            var writer = new StringWriter();
            Console.SetOut(writer);

            Program.Main(new string[0]);

            var output = writer.GetStringBuilder().ToString().Trim();
            Assert.Equal("Hello World!", output);
        }
    }
}
```

This test defines a method (`HelloWorldTest`) decorated with the `[Fact]` attribute (indicating it's a test method). Inside the test, it redirects the Console's output to a `StringWriter`, runs the `Main` method from the `Program` class, retrieves the output, and validates that it is equal to "Hello World!". 

This test would pass if the console correctly outputs "Hello World!" and fail otherwise. 

(Note: This is just a simplified example. Real-world scenarios may have more complex console interaction and would accordingly need more in-depth testing)
