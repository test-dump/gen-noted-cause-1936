They could be verbal or written and should be clear and specific to avoid confusion. Instructions may indicate steps to be followed, procedures to carry out an action, or advice on how to accomplish a task. They are present in various aspects, like technical manuals, recipes, installation guides, or gaming rules. It's important to read and understand instructions well to achieve the desired outcome in the most efficient way."},{"role":"user","content":"Unit tests:\n\nHere are the instructions to create a \"hello world\" console application in C#:\n\n1. Open Visual Studio (VS) on your system. If you haven't installed it, you can download it from the official Microsoft website.\n\n2. After you open VS, click on `Create a new project`.\n\n3. In the `New Project` dialog box, set the `Language` field to C#, set the `Platform` field to `Windows`, and set the `Project type` field to `Console`. This will narrow down the choices.\n\n4. Choose `Console App (.NET Core)` from the provided options and click on `Next`.\n\n5. Next, you'll decide the project's `Name` and `Location` (where the files related to the project will be saved on your system), and click on `Create`.\n\n6. After the project is created, find the `Program.cs` file in the project hierarchy in the `Solution Explorer` (usually found at the side in the upper right corner). If it's not already open, double click the file to open it.\n\n7. You'll see some code already present in the file. Look for the line `static void Main(string[] args)`; this is the entry point of the program.\n\n8. Inside the Main method, add the following code: `Console.WriteLine(\"Hello World!\");`\n\n   Your `Main` method should look like:\n```C#\nstatic void Main(string[] args)\n{\n   Console.WriteLine(\"Hello World!\");\n}\n```\n\n9. Save the file by pressing `CTRL + S` or going to `File -\u003e Save All`.\n\n10. To run the application, press the `F5` key or go to `Debug -\u003e Start Debugging`.\n\n11. A console window will open up displaying the text `Hello World!`.\n\nCongratulations, you have created a simple \"Hello World\" application in C#. Remember to close the console window after you're done."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Code test:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\n\nnamespace HelloWorld\n{\n    class Program\n    {\n        static void Main(string[] args)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Hello World!\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nCode tests or unit tests provide a way to validate that the written code is working as expected. These tests provide mini-scenarios where particular functions or methods produce the expected output given a known input. They are essential in the software development cycle as they ensure the reliability and functionality of code after changes or refactoring. \n\nIn the provided \"Hello World\" application, a unit test would validate that the console outputs \"Hello World!\". However, do note that testing console outputs is typically seen as unconventional in standard unit testing and may involve extra complexity. Normal practice includes testing for business logic, data manipulation, etc.\n\nNevertheless, for the sake of learning, a console test could be written using methods provided by specific testing libraries like the ` Console.SetOut` and `StringWriter` in .NET Core, to redirect Console's output into a string and then compare this string to the expected output. Here's a basic example:\n\n```csharp\nusing Xunit;\nusing System.IO;\nusing System;\n\nnamespace HelloWorld.Tests\n{\n    public class UnitTest1\n    {\n        [Fact]\n        public void HelloWorldTest()\n        {\n            var writer = new StringWriter();\n            Console.SetOut(writer);\n\n            Program.Main(new string[0]);\n\n            var output = writer.GetStringBuilder().ToString().Trim();\n            Assert.Equal(\"Hello World!\", output);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis test defines a method (`HelloWorldTest`) decorated with the `[Fact]` attribute (indicating it's a test method). Inside the test, it redirects the Console's output to a `StringWriter`, runs the `Main` method from the `Program` class, retrieves the output, and validates that it is equal to \"Hello World!\". \n\nThis test would pass if the console correctly outputs \"Hello World!\" and fail otherwise. \n\n(Note: This is just a simplified example. Real-world scenarios may have more complex console interaction and would accordingly need more in-depth testing)"}]
