Open Visual Studio (VS) on your system. If you haven't installed it, you can download it from the official Microsoft website.\n\n2. After you open VS, click on `Create a new project`.\n\n3. In the `New Project` dialog box, set the `Language` field to C#, set the `Platform` field to `Windows`, and set the `Project type` field to `Console`. This will narrow down the choices.\n\n4. Choose `Console App (.NET Core)` from the provided options and click on `Next`.\n\n5. Next, you'll decide the project's `Name` and `Location` (where the files related to the project will be saved on your system), and click on `Create`.\n\n6. After the project is created, find the `Program.cs` file in the project hierarchy in the `Solution Explorer` (usually found at the side in the upper right corner). If it's not already open, double click the file to open it.\n\n7. You'll see some code already present in the file. Look for the line `static void Main(string[] args)`; this is the entry point of the program.\n\n8. Inside the Main method, add the following code: `Console.WriteLine(\"Hello World!\");`\n\n   Your `Main` method should look like:\n```C#\nstatic void Main(string[] args)\n{\n   Console.WriteLine(\"Hello World!\");\n}\n```\n\n9. Save the file by pressing `CTRL + S` or going to `File -\u003e Save All`.\n\n10. To run the application, press the `F5` key or go to `Debug -\u003e Start Debugging`.\n\n11. A console window will open up displaying the text `Hello World!`.\n\nCongratulations, you have created a simple \"Hello World\" application in C#. Remember to close the console window after you're done."}]
